If null, the allowance may inherit the value set on the Customer entity, if the value is set on the customer. | [optional] 
**DepartmentCode** | **string** | The code of the department associated with the sales order line.  Will inherit department code from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.

**Dim3Code** | **string** | The code of the dimension 3 associated with the sales order line.  Will inherit dimension 3 code from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Note that if Dim3Id is set as well in the request, Dim3Id takes precedence and Dim3Code is ignored.  Dim3Code &#x3D; -1 means no dimension 3. | [optional] 
**Dim3Id** | **long** | The id of the dimension 3 associated with the sales order line.  Will inherit dimension 3 id from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Dimension 1-3 are customizable dimensions that can be defined and queried using the Custom Dimensions endpoint.  Dim3Id &#x3D; -1 means no dimension 3. | [optional] 
**ExternalImportReference** | **string** | The external import reference for the sales order line.  This property can be set by integrations posting vouchers in Go or creating sales orders (invoice drafts), in order to reference the external system&#39;s invoice line and ensure a duplicate check (only one instance of the reference can exist within each invoice object).  Can be used to correlate/duplicate check transaction. | [optional]

**ProjectCode** | **string** | The code of the project associated with the sales order line.  Will inherit project code from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Note that if ProjectId is set as well in the request, ProjectId takes precedence and ProjectCode is ignored.  ProjectCode &#x3D; -1 means no project. | [optional] 
**ProjectId** | **long** | The id of the project associated with the sales order line.  Will inherit project id from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Note that if ProjectCode is set as well in the request, ProjectId takes precedence and ProjectCode is ignored.  ProjectId &#x3D; -1 means no project. | [optional] 
**Quantity** | **double** | The quantity for the sales order line.  Required to set if the line contain a product code.  NOTE Setting a negative quantity, will result in the line being interpreted as a creditation of the product quantity.

**SellersReferenceEmployeeId** | **long** | The id of the employee set as the seller reference for the sales order line.  Will inherit the seller reference from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Note that if SellersReferenceEmployeeNo is set as well in the request, SellersReferenceEmployeeId takes precedence and SellersReferenceEmployeeNo is ignored. | [optional] 
**SellersReferenceEmployeeNo** | **long** | The number of the employee set as the seller reference for the sales order line.  Will inherit the seller reference from sales order head if not specifically set on the line.  Note that if SellersReferenceEmployeeId is set as well in the request, SellersReferenceEmployeeId takes precedence and SellersReferenceEmployeeNo is ignored. | [optional] 
**SortOrder** | **int** | The sort order of the sales order line.  Sort order start at 0.  The first line as viewed from the GUI, will have sortOrder &#x3D; 0. | [optional] 
**UnitOfMeasureCode** | **UnitOfMeasureType** |  | [optional] 
**UseStandardSalesAccount** | **bool** | Whether the standard sales account of the product set on the sales order line is used.                 If false, the optional sales account set on the product is used.  Query the product endpoint to retrieve the sales account information on the product.                    If set to null, the standard sales account will be inherited from the customer account&#39;s VAT-free  setting. In other words, if the VAT-free setting is enabled, the StandardSalesAccount will be set to  false and the optional sales account set on the product is used.                The concept of sales accounts is also explained in the common workflow articles. | [optional] 
**VatReturnSpecification** | **VatReturnSpecification** |  | [optional]
