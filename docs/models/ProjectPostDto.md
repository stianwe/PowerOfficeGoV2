**AllowAllEmployees** | **bool** | Value indicating whether all employees can add time-tracking entries with this project.  Default is true.  If this is set to false, the team members working on the project should be specified through the ProjectTeamMembers method.  If the project is a sub-project (parentProjectCode has a value), allow all employees means that this sub-project is allowed to use all the team members specified on the parent project. | [optional]
